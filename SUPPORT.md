### How to support devkitSMS

I sometimes get asked if there's a way to support this devkit/libraries.

First of all, you don't need to. Second, for fiscal reasons, I won't currently accept any money.

Providing feedback, suggest improvements, open issues on GitHub or help with development is gladly received instead!

If you're past this point you might be interested to know that I might accept gifts 😉
I love music, the CD audio being my format of choice, and I love retro stuff in general.
Get in contact with me at sverx@yahoo.com if you're in the EU and you want to send me something.
You totally don't have to, and you can ignore this note. Enjoy programming! ❤️

P.S. If you use promo code WINTER45 on Hedvig.com we both get a small discount on our insurance 😛
